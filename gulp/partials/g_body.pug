      h1 The Day My Mother Forgot to Cry
      p
        | I shudder to recall that dreadful Diwali night of October 2007, when my mother knocked our bed room at the dead of
        | the night enquiring where the toilet was. She looked disoriented and totally confused. Unable to understand the
        | cause for her abnormal behaviour, we thought she was still in a semi-sleep state and showed her the toilet. But
        | even after coming out of toilet she was unable to find her way to her bed room.

      | Sensing that something is seriously amiss, we took her next day to the nearby nursing home for diagnosis and treatment.
      | She was immediately referred to a neurosurgeon and after a MRI scan it was confirmed that she suffered a brain stroke.
      | The report showed certain grey patches which the doctor referred to as clots have affected her memory totally. The
      | doctor informed that the memory loss is irreversible due to her old age. He, however, assured that further, damage
      | to the brain can be arrested with drugs.
