      <h1>The Day My Mother Forgot to Cry</h1>
      <p>
        I shudder to recall that dreadful Diwali night of October 2007, when my mother knocked our bed room at the dead of
        the night enquiring where the toilet was. She looked disoriented and totally confused. Unable to understand the
        cause for her abnormal behaviour, we thought she was still in a semi-sleep state and showed her the toilet. But
        even after coming out of toilet she was unable to find her way to her bed room.
